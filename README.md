# 📊 Regional Sales Analysis

## 📝 Project Description
This project analyzes regional sales performance. It combines data transformation, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboards to derive business insights. Built using Power BI, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), and Excel, this highlights my capability to extract value from complex datasets and make data-driven business recommendations.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The analysis explores sales trends across products, customers, and regions. We merge multiple datasets to derive insights into unit economics, regional demand, customer concentration, and revenue performance relative to budget targets. A Power BI dashboard was built to help decision-makers monitor and navigate this data effectively.

## 📂 Dataset Structure (Source: Kaggle)
Sales Orders: Order-level data with product and customer references.
Customers: Customer names and their index IDs.
Regions: Location details including population, income, and coordinates.
State Regions: Auxiliary mapping (less relevant to final analysis).
Products: Mapping of product descriptions.
2017 Budgets: Sales budget per product for 2017.

## 📈 Insight Summary
Top Performing Products: Identified based on total sales and margin.
Channel Breakdown: Wholesale dominates sales volume; however, export channels offer higher margins.
Customer Insights: Sales are highly concentrated in a few major customers.
Budget Comparison: Several products significantly under- or over-performed against 2017 targets.
Regional Heatmap: Geospatial mapping shows highest demand clusters in populous and high-income regions.

## 💡 Recommendations
Optimize Inventory: Focus on high-margin, high-turnover products.
Channel Strategy: Strengthen high-margin channels such as export.
Customer Diversification: Reduce dependency on a few key clients.
Budget Recalibration: Adjust 2018 forecasts based on historical performance and trend patterns.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Insights
The dashboard is structured with:
Product Performance Page: Top 10 products by revenue, comparison with budget.
Regional Sales Map: Visual breakdown of sales by delivery region.
Customer Contribution: Pareto analysis of top customers.
Monthly Trend: Sales volume and value trends across time.
Channel Efficiency: Channel-based revenue and margin comparisons.
