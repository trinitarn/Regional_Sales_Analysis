This project analyzes regional sales performance. It combines data transformation, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboards to derive business insights. Built using Power BI, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), and Excel, this highlights my capability to extract value from complex datasets and make data-driven business recommendations.
